# Brisca Card Game in C++ with French Deck

## Description

This project is an implementation of the popular card game called Brisca, programmed in C++. In this version, we use a 48-card French deck (without the value '10') instead of the traditional Spanish deck, adding an additional twist to the game. 
Currently, the game can be played between the AI and the Player.

## Rules of the Game

The game of Brisca with a French deck is played very similar to the traditional game with a Spanish deck. The difference is that a French deck has the following four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) and the values are numbers 2 through 9, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.
